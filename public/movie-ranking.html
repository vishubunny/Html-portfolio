<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to BUNNY </h1>
<h2>My Top Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3> 1.Interstellar </h3>
    <p>It's everything a cinema need to be.</p>
<h3>2.Tamasha</h3>
    <p>It is the best character driven movie. Kudos to Ranbir for his stellar act.</p>
<h3>3.Dear Comrade</h3>
    <p>One of those few films which stay with us after the movie and keep us thinking about it. As beautiful as the love story and chemistry between the leads i.e Bobby & lilly is, So, is the plot and message delivered in the end.  000</p>
